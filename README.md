Dashboard: https://mhkhaku.github.io/belly-button-challenge/Code/index.html

## Background

The Belly Button Biodiversity Project dataset, upon analysis, showed that only a few microbial species, also known as operational taxonomic units (OTUs), were found in more than 70% of individuals. The remaining species were less common. This information was obtained through an interactive exploration of the dataset.

## Scope

The aim of this project is to develop an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which provides information about the microbes that inhabit human navels. The dashboard will be linked to an external site and will be updated based on user selection from a dropdown menu. It will consist of three main components:

- A horizontal bar chart that displays the top 10 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) found in the selected individual.
- A bubble chart that shows the data for each sample.
- A table that contains the metadata and paired keys for each sample.
